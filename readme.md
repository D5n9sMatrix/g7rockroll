Polynomials
Maple R has some commands to use with polynomials defined by former
algebraic pressures:
Degree (p, x): degree of polynomial P (x);
Coeffs (p, x): sequence of non -null coefficients of P (x);
COEFF (P, X, N): N-It is p (x) coefficient;
Sort (P): Order the terms according to the decreasing order of the powers;
Quo (F, G, X): Division Quotient of F (x) by g (x);
REM (F, G, X): Rest of the division of f (x) by g (x);
Example 1.27 Determine the degree and coefficients of P (x) = x5 + 4x3 - 10x2 + 7:
